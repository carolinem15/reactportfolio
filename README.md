# React Portfolio

## Description

This app is my professional portfolio using React.js, Reactstrap, and React Router. The purpose of this assignment is to use what we have learned about React so far to craft a unique professional portfolio. Although React has a bit of a learning curve, I thoroughly enjoyed digging into some documentation to learn different methods of styling, passing through props, and navigation. In the future, I plan on adding the projects that I am most proud of to my Projects page, link a messaging system that allows people to get in touch with me directly on my Contact page, and including some more details in my About page.

## Installation

Navigate to the Github Pages link.

## Usage

The homepage for this application is my "About" page. This page contains a brief description of myself. Up in the navigation bar, there is a Projects page that features six projects with a short description and their Github links. There is also a Contact page, which includes ways to get in touch with me via Linkedin and Github.

## Tests

There are no tests for this application.
